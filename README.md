# PERSON-IDENTIFICATION-USING-DEEP-FACE


Deep Face is a facial recognition system developed by Facebook's AI research team. It uses deep learning algorithms to analyze and compare faces in images or videos to identify individuals.

The system works by extracting facial features from an image or video and using those features to create a numerical representation of the face, also known as a face embedding. These embeddings are then compared to a database of known faces to identify the person.

Deep Face has achieved high accuracy rates in identifying individuals, but it has also been criticized for potential privacy violations and ethical concerns. It has been used for law enforcement purposes, which raises questions about the proper use and potential misuse of facial recognition technology.
